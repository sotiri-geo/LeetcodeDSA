        state variables:
        i - current job
        day - current day

        We have to complete 1 job every day, so we need to consider how many 
        we should select on a given day to have remaining jobs available on future days.

        At a given job i and day we have (d - day) remaining, so we need to stop before
        < N - (d - day) in order to give us the opportunity to select at least 1 job on remaining 
        days.

        We know that the difficulty of a day is simply the max difficulty of all jobs selected on
        that day. So if we reached day == d (last day) and there were N - j tasks left, we would need
        to select the max(jobDifficulty[k]) for j <= k < N. We could precompute this as an array 
        at the start to find this value in O(1).
